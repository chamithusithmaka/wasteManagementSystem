# Container Deactivation Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Deactivate Functionality**

When a container is deactivated using `PUT /api/containers/:id/deactivate`:

- âœ… **Container level is set to 0** (as requested)
- âœ… **Status is set to "Out of Service"**
- âœ… **isErrorDetected is set to false** (not an error, intentionally deactivated)
- âœ… **Sensor stops updating** (deactivated containers are skipped)

### 2. **Sensor Simulator Updates**

The sensor simulator now properly handles deactivated containers:

- **Level Updates**: Skips containers that are deactivated (Out of Service + isErrorDetected = false)
- **Error Triggers**: Doesn't trigger errors on deactivated containers
- **Console Messages**: Shows "Container deactivated" instead of treating it as an error

### 3. **Container States**

Now we have clear distinction between different states:

| State | Status | isErrorDetected | containerLevel | Description |
|-------|--------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Active** | Available/Near Full/Full | false | 0-100% | Normal operation |
| **Error** | Needs Maintenance | true | Any | Has a sensor/system error |
| **Deactivated** | Out of Service | false | 0% | Intentionally turned off |
| **Broken** | Out of Service | true | Any | Out of service due to error |

### 4. **New Endpoints**

#### Deactivate Container (Updated)
```
PUT /api/containers/:id/deactivate
```
- Sets level to 0
- Sets status to "Out of Service" 
- Sets isErrorDetected to false (not an error)
- Stops sensor simulation

#### Reactivate Container (New)
```
PUT /api/containers/:id/reactivate
```
- Sets status to "Available"
- Keeps level at 0 (from deactivation)
- Resumes sensor simulation

## Testing URLs

### Deactivate Container
```bash
PUT http://localhost:3000/api/containers/68f06e82544fb106041902f5/deactivate
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Container deactivated successfully",
  "container": {
    "_id": "68f06e82544fb106041902f5",
    "containerId": "CONT001",
    "status": "Out of Service",
    "containerLevel": 0,
    "isErrorDetected": false,
    ...
  }
}
```

### Reactivate Container
```bash
PUT http://localhost:3000/api/containers/68f06e82544fb106041902f5/reactivate
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Container reactivated successfully",
  "container": {
    "_id": "68f06e82544fb106041902f5",
    "containerId": "CONT001", 
    "status": "Available",
    "containerLevel": 0,
    "isErrorDetected": false,
    ...
  }
}
```

## Console Messages

When sensor simulator runs:

- **Active containers**: `ðŸ“¡ Auto Level Update -> Container CONT001: 45% â†’ 47%`
- **Deactivated containers**: `ðŸ“¡ Skipping Level Update -> Container CONT001: Container deactivated`
- **No location containers**: `ðŸ“¡ Skipping Level Update -> Container CONT001: No location assigned`

## Key Benefits

1. **Clear State Management**: Deactivated containers are distinct from error containers
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Sensor simulation doesn't waste cycles on deactivated containers
3. **Zero Level**: Deactivated containers show 0% level as expected
4. **Reversible**: Containers can be reactivated when needed
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing error handling still works
